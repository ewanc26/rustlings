# Rustlings Solutions 📚🦀

Welcome! This repository is a personal archive of my progress through the [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises — hands-on coding challenges designed to help you learn Rust by practising.

## Purpose

This repository is purely for documentation — tracking my learning journey and the time spent solving exercises. It’s not a polished guide or reference, just my own solutions and notes.

## Session Logs

- **Session 1:** Completed Sections 0–6  
  - Took around 2.5 hours  
  - Getting familiar with Rust syntax and compiler feedback
- **Session 2:** Completed Sections 7-9
  - Took around 1.25 hours because I was an idiot with the enums
  - Glad its over
- **Session 3:** Completed Sections 10-12
  - Took around 45 minutes
  - Not that bad compared to Session 2
- **Session 4:** Completed Section 13
  - Took around 2 hours
  - "I got 99 problems and ***all of them are the compiler screaming at me***"
  - I got very distracted with other stuff. I'm restless.

## Environment

- Rust version: `rustc 1.88.0 (6b00bc388 2025-06-23)`  
- OS: macOS

## Notes

- Solutions reflect my thought process and learning pace — not necessarily the tidiest or “best” solutions.  
- All work done within the Rustlings exercises folder.
